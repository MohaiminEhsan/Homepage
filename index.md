## Research Works
### M.Sc. Research work
***Priority-Based Resource Allocation Model for Vehicular Fog Computing***  
**Keywords:** Vehicular Fog Computing, Resource Management, Prioritization, Fuzzy Algorithm, Q-learning  
**Platform:** Veins, SUMO, OMNet++  
**Abstract:** <div style="text-align: justify">Vehicle Fog Computing (VFC) provides opportunities to enhance a vehicle's processing capability as well as support services and applications for intelligent transportation. Due to its low-latency characteristic, VFC has become progressively valuable and appropriate for delay-sensitive applications. Vehicles must overcome substantial obstacles to match the required services and carry out jobs effectively. Several methods have attempted cooperatively pooling idle vehicle resources, and just a few have looked at priority techniques. We concentrate on hierarchically allocating resources based on priorities. Priority is given to resource requests based on some attributes of the vehicle, such as deadlines, distances, and mobility considerations. Dynamic thresholds are determined using the fuzzy membership functions for each vehicular attribute. Prioritization is arranged using a priority queue to identify and assign managed resources under requests and availability. Our proposed method enables fulfilling QoS standards by reducing the length of time a service request spends in the system queue and ensuring high throughput through effective resource allocation. Simulated evaluations revealed decreased response times and total costs for servicing requests in large-scale urban scenarios.  </div>

### B.Ss. Research work
<a href="http://example.com">http://<strong>example</strong>.com</a>
[***Renovo: A Sensor-Based Therapeutic System for Brachial Monoplegia***]{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03631v3.pdf}  
**Keywords:** Assistive Technology, Effective Interventions, Inertial Sensors, Neurological Disorders, Quantitative
Assessment Protocol, Real-time Visualization, Reliable Measurement    
**Abstract:** <div style="text-align: justify">Stroke patients with Upper Limb Disability (ULD) are re-acclimated to their lost motor capability through therapeutic interventions, following assessment by Physiotherapists (PTs) using various qualitative assessment protocols. However, the assessments are often biased and prone to errors. Real-time visualization and quantitative analysis of various Performance Metrics (PMs) of patient’s motion data, such as - Range of Motion (RoM), Repetition Rate (RR), Velocity (V), etc., may be vital for proper assessment. In this study, we present Renovo, a wearable inertial sensor-based therapeutic system, which assists PTs with real-time visualization and quantitative patient assessment, while providing patients with progress feedback. We showcase the results of a three-week pilot study on the rehabilitation of ULD patients (N=16), in 3 successive sessions at one-week interval, following evaluation both by Renovo and PTs (N=5). Results suggest that sensor-based quantitative assessment reduces the possibility of human error and bias, enhancing efficiency of rehabilitation.  </div>
